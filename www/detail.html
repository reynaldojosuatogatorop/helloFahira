                            web design. You can read more here. Continue reading this article for latest info. A design is a
                            plan or specification for the construction of an object or system or for the implementation of
                            an activity or process, or the result of that plan or specification in the form of a prototype,
                        product or process.</p>
                        <p>The verb to design expresses the process of developing a design. In some cases, the direct
                            construction of an object without an explicit prior plan (such as in craftwork, some
                        engineering, coding, & graphic design) may also be a design activity.</p>
                        <p>The design usually has to satisfy certain goals and constraints, may take into account aesthetic,
                            functional, economic, or socio-political considerations, and is expected to interact with a
                        certain environment. </p>
